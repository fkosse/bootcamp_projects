!!! Throws an error because aggregate functions cannot be used in WHERE


!!! WHERE has to be before GROUP BY

!!! HAVING comes after GROUP BY

We want the average fertility, minimum and maximum population 
per continent
 with two conditions: 1
1. Continent name starts with â€˜A
2. Average fertility < 2

SELECT continent, AVG(fertility), MIN(population), MAX(population)
FROM countries
WHERE continent LIKE 'A%'
GROUP BY continent
HAVING AVG(fertility) < 2;

SELECT continent, AVG(fertility), MIN(population), MAX(population)
FROM countries
GROUP BY continent;
