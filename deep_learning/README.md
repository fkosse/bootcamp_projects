# Deep Learning and Image Recognition 
Building an Artificial Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 'go ot page') dataset.

### Business Problem:

![handwritten_digits](digits.png)

Assume you want to sort 100 million letters with a handwritten postal code per year.
Assume that the sorting machine will achieve your test accuracy for each of five digits in the code.

What is the probability of a postal code assigned correctly?

If sorting an unrecognized letter manually costs 10 cent, what will be the impact of improving the accuracy by 0.1%?

Numbers for reference: the new DHL logistic centre in Bochum is processing up to 50000 parcels per hour. On peak days 11 million per day. Of course, most of these donâ€™t have handwritten digits, but it illustrates the size of the task.
